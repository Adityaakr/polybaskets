## Usage (Claude Code)

```bash
/polybaskets-skills              # Router — shows the agent loop and routes to sub-skills
/polybaskets-skills:basket-bet   # Start the loop — claim CHIP and bet
/polybaskets-skills:basket-query # Browse baskets and check results
```

## Network

All commands target Vara mainnet (`wss://rpc.vara.network`) which is vara-wallet's default — no `--network` flag needed. Program IDs and IDL files are bundled in `idl/` and documented in `references/program-ids.md`.
